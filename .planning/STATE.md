# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Python is the UI, Rust is the engine — every piece of business logic lives in Rust `-core` crates, Python only handles presentation and user interaction.
**Current focus:** v8.3.0 Performance & Polish — Phase 13 complete

## Current Position

Phase: 13 of 17 (Benchmark Infrastructure) - COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase - ALL COMPLETE
Status: Phase complete, ready for Phase 14
Last activity: 2026-02-05 — Completed 13-02-PLAN.md (business logic crate benchmarks)

Progress: [v1.0: 14/14] [v8.2.0-part2: 14/14] [v8.3.0: 4/8]
[#####################---] 89% (32/36 plans)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All milestone decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Highlighted decisions:**
- Rust-only, hard fail: no Python fallback for any migrated component
- Delete Python orchestrators entirely (not deprecate-first)
- GIL release audit must happen before baselines (research finding)
- Split GIL and Benchmark work into separate phases for cleaner deliverables
- 1ms threshold guideline for GIL release decisions
- YAML operations have architectural limitation - Python<->Rust dict conversion requires GIL
- Quick/thorough benchmark modes via BENCH_MODE env var (quick: 50 samples, thorough: 200 samples)
- Shared benchmark config via #[path] attribute (not crate dependency)
- Real crash logs embedded via include_str! for scanlog benchmarks

### Pending Todos

- Fix test_clear_cache in classic-yaml-core (tracked as BUG-01)
- Fix classic_settings() path resolution (tracked as BUG-02)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
