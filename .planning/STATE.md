# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Python is the UI, Rust is the engine — every piece of business logic lives in Rust `-core` crates, Python only handles presentation and user interaction.
**Current focus:** v8.3.0 Performance & Polish — Phase 12: GIL Release Audit

## Current Position

Phase: 12 of 17 (GIL Release Audit)
Plan: 0 of 1 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-04 — Roadmap revised (split Phase 12)

Progress: [v1.0: 14/14] [v8.2.0-part2: 14/14] [v8.3.0: 0/8]
[################--------] 78% (28/36 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 14
- Average duration: 12m
- Total execution time: ~2.8 hours

**v8.2.0-part2 Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 14
- Average duration: ~12m
- Total execution time: ~2.7 hours

**By Phase (v8.2.0-part2):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 06-foundation-settings | 2/2 | ~15m | ~7.5m |
| 07-game-detection | 2/2 | ~27m | ~13.5m |
| 08-report-generation | 2/2 | ~15m | ~7.5m |
| 09-orchestration-migration | 4/4 | ~76m | ~19m |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All milestone decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Highlighted decisions:**
- Rust-only, hard fail: no Python fallback for any migrated component
- Delete Python orchestrators entirely (not deprecate-first)
- GIL release audit must happen before baselines (research finding)
- Split GIL and Benchmark work into separate phases for cleaner deliverables

### Pending Todos

- Fix test_clear_cache in classic-yaml-core (tracked as BUG-01)
- Fix classic_settings() path resolution (tracked as BUG-02)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
