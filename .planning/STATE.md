# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-02)

**Core value:** Python is the UI, Rust is the engine — every piece of business logic lives in Rust `-core` crates, Python only handles presentation and user interaction.
**Current focus:** v8.2.0-part2 Rust Migration - Phase 7 (Game Detection)

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 11 (Game Detection)
Plan: Ready to plan
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-03 — Phase 6 verified and complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v8.2.0-part2 decisions:
- Rust is 90-100% complete for all migration targets; work is wiring, validation, and Python removal
- Golden file capture happens in Phase 6 before migrations to ensure parity baseline
- Settings migration first (dependency for other components)
- Golden file masking uses {{TIMESTAMP}} and {{PATH}} placeholders
- Capture intermediate outputs (segments + analysis) per log for debugging parity issues

### Pending Todos

- Fix test_clear_cache in classic-yaml-core (pre-existing bug, tracked separately)
- Pre-existing GUI file path resolution issue in classic_settings() (relative path for CLASSIC Settings.yaml)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
