# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Repository

Primary tracker repository: `evildarkarchon/CLASSIC-Fallout4`.

Infer the repo from `git remote -v` when running inside this clone; `gh` normally does this automatically.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels when needed.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `gh issue edit <number> --remove-label "..."`
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.**

Do not pull external PRs into the `/triage` queue. Triage GitHub Issues only unless this file is updated.

If this is changed to `yes` later, PRs should run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments`, then keep only `authorAssociation` values of `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, or `NONE`.
- **Comment, label, or close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label` or `gh pr edit --remove-label`, and `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either. Resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.
